     <h1> About </h1>
     <p class ="description">
     <img src="profile.jpg" class="profile-pic"> </img> I'm Noah Mifsud Lattari, an American-Canadian rising senior Computer Science student at
     Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario.
     <br> <br>
     Soon, I'll be interning at Tesla as a Software
     Engineer Intern working on 3D Modelling. After, I'm back to Ryerson for my final semester. I'm set to graduate in spring 2021.
     <br> <br>
     I'm thinking of pursuing graduate studies in the area of Computer Graphics/Computer Vision. I'd like to use
     computation to help us understand the brain more, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-brain-computer-interface-and-convolutional-neural-networks-9f35bd4af948">specifically brain-computer interfaces (BCI)</a>.
     <br> <br>
     Growing up, I loved watching things that explored this topic, as silly as it may be, my interests came from popular movies and shows
     like Sword Art Online, The Matrix, Ready Player One, and Ender's Game. The idea of creating worlds that seemed as real as life by simulating cognitive
     senses was super interesting to me.
     <br> <br>
     I have a pretty broad range of experience, ranging from student leadership, teaching, quality assurance, software development, and
     research. Feel free to <a href="mailto:noah.lattari@gmail.com">contact me</a> to connect :).

     At the <a href="https://ryecscu.com/">Ryerson CSCU</a> I've held multiple positions, currently I volunteer as the Vice President of Academics. This entails
     me to handle all matters pertaining to undergraduate courses, grading, degree specializations, and academic events.
     <br> <br>
     This usually involves taking feedback from students about current computer science courses, whether that be complaints or suggestions for improvement. We then
     bring this feedback up during board meetings with professors in the faculty.
     <br><br>
     I also handle getting new courses approved for our degree. Currently, we are trying to add a mandatory statistics class in the undergraduate curriculum due to <thead>
     growing popularity of Machine Learning. Speaking of ML, we are also pushing for two new <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/calendar/2019-2020/programs/science/computer_sci/table_i/">degree concentrations</a>
     in Machine Learning and Computer Security.

    I joined the CSCU originally just to get something to put on my resume, but honestly It's been the most fun I've had at university. Ryerson can sometimes feel isolating due to its downtown campus and commuter
    vibe. After joining the CSCU I made a bunch of great friends and immediately the campus felt more like a home, and less like a business to me. I'm committed to making Ryerson Computer Science the best program it
    can be before I graduate.

During the 2017 & 2018 <a href="https://www.rssonline.ca/">Ryerson Science Society</a> week of welcome, I was a student frosh leader. I got to take a bunch of incoming
science students around campus to various events. Overall was a pretty great opportunity to get more involved with other academic disciplines and meet tons
of new students.

In first and second year, I played competitive collegiate League of Legends for <a href="https://ryersonrams.ca/sports/2019/9/16/esports.aspx?path=esp">Ryerson eSports</a>. Honestly I used to dedicate a
lot of time to LoL, from grinding ranked queue, scrims, practices, and LANs, my grades definitely suffered. I reached a peak rank of "Diamond 3" which is the top 0.3% of all
North American League players. A lot of people have asked me if it was worth it, or if I wished I spent my time studying or preparing for internships, and honestly it 100% was.
<br> <br>
I think getting "good" at League of Legends taught me how to get good at something. It taught me a lot of things from leadership, dedication, and performing under pressure.
I may write a whole post about this sometime, but for now check out a similar post from Ryerson alumni <a href="https://medium.com/@sistillianthony/i-dedicated-4-years-of-my-life-to-mastering-one-of-the-hardest-esports-in-the-world-and-this-is-my-2f0d3cc6c67d">Anthony Sistilli about Starcraft II and his career.</a>

<h3> Interests & Hobbies </h3>
<p class="description">
Other things I'm interested in are coffee & tea making, competitive LoL (mentioned), keyboards, biking, bouldering, and hiking. I grew up in Northern-Ontario so I really like anything to do with the outdoors. I'd like to
someday move out of the city, but not today :^).
