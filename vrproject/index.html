              Horde Survival is a Virtual Reality game/simulation written in C# with Unity. The purpose of the game
              is simply to see how long you survive against endless hordes of randomly generated enemies. Enemies spawn
              in all different directions, so having top-notch reactions are a key for survival.

              Horde Survival consists of, well surviving a horde of enemies. There are 3 spawn points
              (in front, to the left, and to the right) where enemies may spawn, each spawn point is computed
              randomly. The player needs to be constantly aleart to react quick enough to skeletons spawning around
              them.
              At first it may seem easy, but the spawn rate becomes exponentially higher the longer the player survives.

              Horde Survival consists of surviving a horde of enemies. There are 3 spawn points (in front, to the left, and to the right) where enemies may spawn, with each spawn point computed randomly. The player needs to be constantly alert to react quickly enough to skeletons spawning around them. At first it may seem easy, but the spawn rate becomes exponentially higher the longer the player survives. The cap is at a certain number since you can't spawn infinite skeletons, but it does get really hard. The goal of the game is to see how high of a combo you can get (my record is around 100). After dying, the player is taken to a death screen and told to try again.
              <br><br>
              The game pays homage to some of my favourite video games, such as music from "Super Smash Brothers: Melee", sound effects from "Minecraft", and a game over screen inspired by "Earthbound".

              I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it. It's available for download <a href="https://gitlab.scs.ryerson.ca/nlattari/cps643-labs/tree/master/FinalProject">here</a>. Just open the "Assets" folder in Unity 2017.3.0 and run any of the scenes.flex-item flex-item-stretch flex-column">
